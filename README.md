Physiologically relevant human skin models that include key skin cell types (i.e., keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) can be used for in vitro drug testing or skin pathology studies, as well as clinical applications such as skin grafts. However, there is still no golden standard for such a model. We herein investigated the potential of a recombinant functionalized spider silk protein, FN-silk, for the construction of a dermal, an epidermal, as well as a bilayered skin equivalent. More specifically, two formats of FN-silk (i.e., 3D network and nanomembrane) were evaluated. The FN-silk 3D network was used as an elastic matrix that provides the dermis with ECM-like support. Additionally, FN-silk, in the form of a thin and permeable nanomembrane, was used as a basal membrane to support the epidermal epithe-lium. The BSE was obtained by combining the 3D network and the nanomembrane. To evalu-ate the cell behavior within the developed models, relative markers were visualized with immunofluorescence microscopy, and gene expression was analyzed with spatial transcriptomics (ST).
This repository conatins the script that was used to analyse the ST data produced on the 10x Visium platform.
